### Hector

Hector is a private group chat server for people you trust. It speaks a small subset of the IRC protocol and is written in [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org/) with the [EventMachine](http://rubyeventmachine.com/) library.

Existing IRC servers are complex beasts. They're designed for large public networks that need to handle tens of thousands of concurrent connections. They're written in C so they're difficult to modify and often vulnerable to security exploits. Setting them up takes hours of configuration in special syntax and requires knowledge of jargon like "jupe" and "O-line."

Worse, they're hampered by years of legacy decisions. Access control and permissions are handled by an arcane set of user and channel modes and commands, enforced by "services bots" that need to be maintained separately from the servers themselves. And servers are encumbered with controls for rate limiting and spam protection because they're intended for public use.


### A private chat server for people you trust

Hector is different: it lets you create a private chat server for people you trust. It's designed for small groups of friends who are comfortable using IRC clients to talk to each other but don't want the administrative overhead of a public server.

Hector implements _just enough_ of the IRC protocol that existing IRC clients can connect and chat. Unlike other servers, Hector has no bans, modes, ops, opers, or channel keys -- but you do need a user name and password to connect. So you either have full access, or you don't have any access at all.

There are no administrative commands built into Hector. You can grant or deny access to users with a simple command-line tool. If you need finer control over connections, use your operating system's firewall (or find better friends).

Modifying Hector is easy because it's written in Ruby. Implementing a new command is as simple as defining a method. Connecting Hector to your existing authentication system is straightforward too.


### Supported commands

Hector supports a limited subset of IRC commands.

- `USER` and `PASS` -- Authenticates you to the server. (Your client sends these as soon as it connects.)
- `NICK` -- Sets your nickname.
- `JOIN` -- Joins a channel.
- `PRIVMSG` and `NOTICE` -- Sends a message to another nickname or channel.
- `TOPIC` -- Changes or returns the topic of a channel.
- `NAMES` -- Shows a list of which nicknames are on a channel.
- `WHO` -- Like `NAMES`, but returns more information. (Your client probably sends this when it joins a channel.)
- `WHOIS` -- Shows information about a nickname, including how long it has been connected.
- `PART` -- Leaves a channel.
- `AWAY` -- Marks or unmarks you as being away.
- `INVITE` -- Invites another user to a channel.
- `PING` -- (Your client uses this command to measure the speed of its connection to the server.)
- `QUIT` -- Disconnects from the server.


### Installation and usage

Install Hector with RubyGems and create your server:

    $ gem install -r hector
    $ hector setup myserver
    ...
    $ cd myserver.hect

Set up your first user account:

    myserver.hect$ hector identity remember sam
    Enter password:

Start the Hector daemon:

    myserver.hect$ hector daemon

By default, the server will listen at 0.0.0.0 (any IP address) on port 6767 for unencrypted clients and on 6868 for encrypted.  These settings can be configured by modifying `init.rb` in your server's directory with any combination of the following:

    Hector.server_address = "111.222.333.444"
    Hector.port = 9000
    Hector.ssl_port = 9001

You can connect Hector to an existing authentication scheme by again modifying `init.rb` in your server's directory:

    Hector::Identity.adapter = MyIdentityAdapter.new(...)

where `MyIdentityAdapter` is a class whose instances respond to `authenticate(username, password, &block)` and `normalize(username)`. See `lib/hector/yaml_identity_adapter.rb` for an example.

If you require [em-synchrony](https://github.com/igrigorik/em-synchrony), Hector will start EventMachine's run loop using `EventMachine.synchrony`. Simply `require "em-synchrony"` somewhere in `init.rb`. (In an identity adapter, for example.)
